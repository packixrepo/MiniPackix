# MiniPackix
Run a small repo instance that connects to the Packix DRM API

The future goal of this project comes in two phases

#### Phase 1

Phase 1 is to create a easy to run repo that can integrate with the Packix DRM API so that packix sellers can have beta repos for their paid packages.

#### Phase 2

Allow a developer to be able to export all relevant Packix data into an instance if at sometime Packix no longer wants to exist this will give developers an easy transition (would support PayPal and Stripe keys out of the box so developer's can keep on selling on their own)

THIS WILL NOT BE A MULTITENANT SYSTEM.


The goal of this project is also to explore ways to speed up Packix using experimental tech and different stacks to get most bang for your buck performance wise.
